Top 50 Best Movies Ever Made - IMDb Scraper

This project aims to scrape data from IMDb's list of the top 50 best movies ever made. Using web scraping techniques with Python and the BeautifulSoup library, I extracted key information such as movie titles, stars, run time, genre, ratings, directors, and release years from the IMDb website. The scraping script is provided as a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to run and modify as needed.

Features:

•	Scrapes IMDb's list of the top 50 best movies ever made.

•	Extracts movie titles, stars, run time, genre, ratings, directors, and release years.

•	Stores the scraped data in a pandas  DataFrame for easy analysis and visualization.

•	Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
